# bfInterpreter
A very simple brainf\*ck interpreter I pieced together in C++. 

" Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.
The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. " -from Wikipedia

The 8 commands are :

| Command        | Explanation           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| >   |increment the data pointer  | 
| < |    decrement the data pointer   |    
| + | increment the byte at the data pointer     |  
| - |decrement the byte at the data pointer    |    
| . | output the byte at the data pointer      |   
| , | accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer      |   
| [ | if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command     |   
| ] |if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command      |    



The interpreter reads a file containing bf code and stores contents in the instruction memory. It ignores any non-bf characters.
It then proceeds to execute the commands one by one. 

The data memory and the instruction memory are 30,000 bytes each (arbitrary number )
