# bfInterpreter
A very simple brainfuck interpreter I pieced together in C++. Not optimised for space or time.

The program reads a file and stores the brainfuck code in the instruction memory. It ignores any non-brainfuck characters in the file.
It then proceeds to execute the brainfuck commands one by one. 

The data memory and the instruction memory are 30,000 bytes each.
